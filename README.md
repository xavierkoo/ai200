## Project Particulars

### Aim
The project aim was to determine whether online bids made on an auction site were from humans or bots. Analyzed more than 7 million online auction bids and trained an ensemble model by performing feature engineering in Python to classify the bids as done by humans or robots. Used RandomForest, XGBoost, CatBoost and Plotly library for data visualization and model evaluation to get the optimal prediction AUC in practice.

Achieved a 0.87067 AUC score.
